# NBA_Stats_System

This project will collect stats from the remaining four teams from the NBA playoffs (Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics). It will use this data to log rankings of these teams by the team stats. 

The project will be a Maven project written in Java and will use JUnit testing. It will focus on using logging files, identity classes, and improved coding conventions. 

The collaborators on this project will be Tuan and Avi. The project will be pulled daily and features/functionality will be implemented on seperate branches from master. After the finished features are approved by the other collaborators, the finished branch will be merged back into master.
